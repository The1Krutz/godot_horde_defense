# Godot Horde Defense

## Introduction

I kept seeing ads on Tiktok for mobile games that had the palyer moving a group of people around trying to survive a horde of zombies or something. Passing over pickup areas to modify the group to do better or worse.

No idea if the game is actually like that, or if it exists. I didn't check and I don't care. I'm making something mechanically similar to the ad.
